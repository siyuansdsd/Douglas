[Road detection demo](https://douglas-yang-19990310-demo-video.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/roaddetection.MP4)


- Implemented the researchers' models by utilizing **Python** and **OpenCV2**.

- Implemented CV detection (road, face, gait, size ...) functions by utilizing **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**.

- Customized operators on filters in solving the noise of the images with a good effect in tasks of detecting sizes of components (screw, nut, pills, ...).

- Worked with the researchers of **Global Top 1 Research Institution**.
